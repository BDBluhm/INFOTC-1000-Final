<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<p>
I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in Information Technology at MU, I believe I will continue like this until graduation. After that I'm thinking I'll go back home to Smithville to live with my dad.
<br>
Theres a huge Facebook datacenter currently being built right on the outskirts of Smithville, and I'm hoping that it will be just finishing by the time I graduate. My plan is to apply to work there right as its being completed, as they'll be needing a lot of employees quickly. That way I'll be able to work in my prefered field and gain experience right out of school.
<br>
I'm also thinking of taking some time soon to complete my CCNA certification, for working in network administration. I should be able to do that if I put my mind to it one summer, and having that would really give me a boost in the job market.
