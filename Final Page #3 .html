<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
I am currently a sophomore in the University of Columbia Missouri, having transfered here from the Missouri University of Science and Technology after my freshman year. I graduated Smithville High School in 2021, having completed my senior year online during Covid-19. My last two years of high school, I went on the Northland Career Center program, where I studied the Information Technology course and earned a PCPro Certification. I was also given the oppourtunity to do an online internship at Cerner my senior year, working in data analytics.
Those years are what inspired me to pursue a degree in Info Tech.
